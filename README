epflo extrapolates optical flow from smaller FLO or FLOW files to a
higher resolution.

Usage: epflo -w widht -h height [-x scale_x] [-y scale_y] in-file out-file
  -w width      width of the output file
  -h height     height of the output file
  -x scale_x    extrapolation factor in x direction
  -y scale_y    extrapolation factor in y direction

  in-file       input file name (usually a .flo or .flow file)
  out-file      output file name

Example:
   epflo -w 316 -h 252 -x 5.0 -y 5.0 input.flow output.flow

epflo warns if it can't detect either a FLO or FLOW file. Note that FLOW
files are similar to the Middleburry FLO format, but in addition, each
vector has an additional confidence value

FLO Format:
	PIEHwhu0v0...unvn

FLOW format:
	PIEIwhu0v0c0...unvncn
